# Hulu 2.0 clone

Hulu 2.0 clone application made with Next.js framework and Tailwind css.

## Description

This web application is created for purpose of learning not only Next.js framework, but also Tailwind css.

## Implementation

Application is made in Next.js which is framework of React that comes with numerous features that facilitate building web apps. Some of them are: image optimization built-in techniques, such as Lazy-loading, back-end functionality, server-side rendering by default, file-system routing which for example means that relative route to a page component from main component becomes a route in browser. It also has TypeScript support and fast refresh feature which are useful when developing.

When it comes to visual appearance of application, I used Tailwind css for styling. It has various built-in utilities and classes that can be used for achieving great UI & UX 'without ever leaving html', as they say in the documentation.

IDE for development was Visual Studio Code.
